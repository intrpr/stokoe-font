# stokoe-font
Creating a font with fidelity to Stokoe's 1960, 1965 documentation.

These letters look like they were made from an architectural tracing template.

Update 2025-03-12: This typeface is actually Gorton (and probably some handdrawn alterations). Compare with "The hardest working font in Manhattan," https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan. It looks like Gorton was based on some earlier versions of the faces I added below. Versions of this font:
- https://github.com/drdnar/GortonDigital
- So need to figure out a way to use FontForge (https://fontforge.org/en-US) to make a version from these .sfd and .ff files

Update 2021-02-26: This appears to be a typeface called Upright Gothic. Appears to have roots in 1910s? 1940s? 1960s? engineering architectural lettering templates with any combination of the words 'vertical' (vs. 'slanted') 'single-stroke' 'mechanical' 'single line' 'commercial' 'gothic' 'capitals'

- slash-zero (similar to &#x00D8; but using a zero, not an O)
