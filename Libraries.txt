EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, 
you cannot claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. 
Using the code is permitted in any program, product, or library, 
non-commercial or commercial. Giving credit is not required, though 
is a nice gesture. The code comes as-is, and if there are any flaws 
or problems with any Gems code, nobody involved with Gems - authors,
editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to be held responsible. 
Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free comes 
with no guarantee.
